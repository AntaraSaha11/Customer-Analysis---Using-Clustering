# Customer-Analysis---Using-Clustering



Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

In this work i will do a cluster analysis for the problem of customer segmentation in the store
Cluster analysis refers to an unsupervised machine learning task (when there are no labels in the dataset)
Cluster analysis is used where we need to break the general population into different groups, where the objects in each group are most similar to each other. In our example, we break the general population into separate groups in order to analyze these groups separately and, for example, make recommendations for purchases for them
